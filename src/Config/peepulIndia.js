const TEXT1 = `At Peepul, we look to improve learning outcomes in the public education system, by enabling ‘meaningful teacher-student interaction’. If a child is meaningfully and effectively engaged in the classroom by the teacher, she attends classes regularly, engages in learning, and in turn, achieves learning.`;
const TEXT2 = `Towards this, we closely partner with national, state, and local governments to design and implement high-quality, scalable solutions that create these high-performing teachers, through a combination of training, coaching and performance management.`;
const TEXTHEAD = `What we do?`;
